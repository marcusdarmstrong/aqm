Stuff you'll need:

Temperature/Pressure/Humidity/VOC Sensor $19.95 (https://www.adafruit.com/product/5046)
PM Sensor $44.95 (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4632)
Microcontroller $24.95 (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4769)
Cables 2x $0.95 (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4399)
[optional] Battery $6.95 (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3898)

The battery is capable of powering the sensor for something like 2h, so it's really only useful for pretty short term stuff movements and such.

USB-C Cable
USB-PD Power Supply
A machine to run the monitoring software


How to:

Assemble the components. This is super easy, there's no soldering, and the sensors daisy chain so there's no real wrong way to do it.

Install the Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

Install the ESP32-S2 Board Support: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html#installing-using-boards-manager

Install the PM2.5 sensor library:

Install Prometheus Arduino:
https://github.com/grafana/prometheus-arduino

Set the required configuration in the provided sketch:

#define WIFI_SSID "Wifi SSID"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "***********"
#define NODE "kitchen" // This is an identifying name for the controller so multiples can be distinguished in prometheus across locations in your home, for example.
#define URL "Marcuss-MBP.localdomain" // The hostname pointing to your prometheus instance
#define PATH "/api/v1/write" // This is the default remote write path prometheus will use
#define PORT 9090 

Plug in the board via USB-C and upload the provided sketch to the board: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-esp32-s2-feather/using-with-arduino-ide
